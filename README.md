Eyes on Cinema Feb 2, 2025 from mm/dd/yyyy
I remember being on a table The Entity I remember is very very tall. The face was exactly like a 
praying mantis and it moved its head in very jerky like manner. And I'm pretty sure just in my own 
heart that that's not the first time. In 1965 there's one being in particular that I always recognize 
and he's not a gray. He's taller, he's thinner, he's got a bigger head, he's got bigger eyes. His limbs 
are very pray mantis like. I remember being on the table with my head turned away not wanting to 
look at this creature. And then when I looked at him I just recognized him as the one that I hated. 
You find yourself on a table and these creatures around you with instruments and you have no 
idea what they're doing. And and they don't tell you. My skin was sliced like with the surgical 
instrument. 

When a person's abducted there a physical examination. The focus of the entire enterprise 
seems to me to be unmistakably on reproductive issues. And I closed my eyes and when I opened them 
again I found myself in a room. I was laying on a table and I had six beings. I couldn't tell 
you what they were doing because I really don't know. But, I remember the one that was on the left 
of my head took something from my head. The person will describe being on a table which is generally 
metallic. They are unable to move and the beings were standing around me. Looking at me. 
Examining my body. Now, when they're on the table they describe operations which take place. The next 
thing I remember they have this thing in front of my eye. Like a metal instrument that was kind of 
like shaped like an 'l' and stuck it. It went all the way back down to here though in my throat. As 
proof the operations have taken place, those who believe they were abducted often point to 
unexplainable scars. Even implants. My mother remembers me 
pointing out that I had a scar on my leg. She said it never bled. The scar 
appeared simultaneously with Jesse's abduction experience at age 4 in 1956. 
Beneath the scar Jesse could always feel a small object. I remembered being taken
into the C CFT taken into one room I was placed on a very
cold flat table. My brother was separated and was taken into another room. They
were doing something down to my legs. I could feel them poking and prodding around my legs. 
I ran down the hill. The three of us ran down the hill. We thought we were running home. We went 
into this man, in dark clothing, tall dark eyes, then there was a sense of floating and 
then being on a table. Of having feelings of eyes put on our legs and lights shine in our eyes. 
And that's all I remember. And there were six of them and they all looked the same now I
just can't accept this like a cliched saucer you know circular and and very large and L do you
remember being in it as well Wendy I do mhm and just lying on a a table with faces looking over me and Scot saw the
same figures uh like hockey mask figures if you can imagine the hockey mask and
um yeah nasty looking equipment they had a couple of tables in it it was like one table laying down a
long narrow one and one up in the air only on a
hinge I think I was laying on one it was like they had Terry standing
up against the other one was like he was tied there he couldn't
move or clamped in did they at any time say anything to
you was like there was communication how does the communication
take place like a thought did they tell you or communicate
with you that you would not remember this that it was Secret
not then did did later yeah did you ever see at T what they
looked like they were big he was standing quite ways
above Farms like maybe what sort of Suits or things were
they wearing maybe a rubber like would you see their
eyes yeah they were like holes deep
holes the glaring of the eyes seem like their eyes can to
trolled brain okay describe what happened during the
examination I got very cold don't have much feeling
left was like they put something numb on me how many kinds of tests or how many
kinds of examinations took place they checked everything on my body did you
feel somebody was touching you I with instruments or with hands with
instruments uhhuh maybe like a little
knife small one when they put it in my nose it felt like it was scraping
it I think they opened my head and examined my brain I know it's like they dissect
a like we dissect a frog they had large heads and big black
eyes and I it was very fuzzy I was almost
passed out at that time I and they floated you up onto the spacecraft and then what happened they put me onto a
table and they showed me a long needle and they put the edge of the needle into
my navl I'm finding in my case is many chilling
similarities the person is taken against their will taken into a
craft of some kind put on a
table the women begin to experience the gynecological examinations done by the
aliens on them they feel very violated with the men anal probe
are inserted and sperm is taken it's all
done against their will and they're really help us to do anything about it the next thing I remember after after
the going up was being on a table and that's the first time they
did what uh like a
Gynecology yeah yeah exam on me for a 12 years old kid mhm and no you were scared
yeah it was a shock cuz I was pretty naive I didn't really have any clue of
how my body worked anyway and then have these things around me
and um putting they um they check me out and they put
something in me and it was it was really traumatic at the time it uh I feel like
it sort of took some of my innocence away at the time and um it bothered me they took me
into a room uh I was told to disrobe and I was embarrassed I didn't want to
undress and yet I couldn't stop um they told me to take my wedding rings
off um which I did and then they led me to a table and laid me down I remember
them telling me that I was either going to have a baby or that I was pregnant I wasn't quite sure
but what they had done was remove a fetus from
me and implanted another which was really emotionally uh
hard for me they've gone in with needles through my abdomen they have gone in
through the vagina and taken out small what look like fetuses that couldn't
possibly survive women say routinely that eggs are extracted from them that
this is something that is common it's common for every woman who
has ovaries intact uh we we don't really see a whole lot of exceptions to that I'm sure there
are exceptions to it but but it's it's extremely common and harvesting
eggs all of these are drawing by abduct it's white it's so white it's
like it's round I can see Helen she's on a board it's shaped like a table like a
school table there's something on the ceiling it looks like operating
something which will come down my eyes they're looking into my eyes it feels like a burning sensation
in my eye there look like gray people I think
more white than there was gray like and the big um alond eyes very big and um
you can hardly see a nose but you know a nose is there and a mouth sometimes the
mouth is not there other times you know there sort of a line in fact sometimes
you can see like a only tiny red line there he's touching my face touching my
hair now looking at my heart they're looking at my
eyes what basically is happening is people are being examined medically they're having toenails removed they're
having hair removed they're having skin samples removed I was lying on a table um on my
back and my head was placed in a a kind of restraint and I saw this instrument
coming down toward my face I was terrified first of all secondly when I realized what they were going to do with this pronged instrument I
couldn't believe it Beth claimed she could feel the pressure of her eyeball being pulled free of the socket and that
it was extremely painful unconcerned the aliens went about their
business something was done behind the eyeball some procedure behind the eyeball that I could feel but I couldn't
see obviously the eyeball was then
in some way reinserted or replaced in the socket I was pushed into a room that
I describe as a a large Hospital Ward um there were tiny little tables about a
foot and a half uh tall all through this Hospital Ward and there were uh
unconscious human beings laying on all of these tables and there were these little um short off-white beans naked
guys with uh big black eyes um doing things to these people on these tables I
can then remember um arriving in a room that had like a
platform table in the center and being made to lay on on this table um and I
had various medical things done to me at that time I had something placed actually into my head behind my ear that
caused me a great deal of pain um I also had something placed up
my nose um and at that point I thought I was going to die but I didn't um I had
various sort of needle things poked into me and I was prodded by the aliens were're doing all this by these little
beings yes um little 3 and 1/2 ft tall beings 10 gray in color with very big
eyes big heads and then later on there was a larger being about 5T tall
slightly different color um that came up and kept staring into my face and was
showing me all these images and and things and I had something actually at one point moving around inside of my
stomach um and at that point I can remember just feeling as though I wanted to die uh they brought me forward into a
room which uh looked exactly well not exactly but it's
reminiscent of what a doctor's office would look like it appeared to be a medical room uh there was a table in
there and they led me over to the table and
um somewhere in the process I was disrobed and they laid me upon the table and and um
performed some kind of medical procedures um
they appeared to be gynecological in nature and um after a
time of Performing these procedures they finally got through with whatever they were doing
and uh then they they got me on up from the table he rose up and when he got to
the end of the cloud he passed out and woke up on an examining table and that's
uh the time in between he didn't remember anything of course when he first came back he didn't remember a
whole lot of that either that took time to develop the the details by stressing
his memory to get it first thing I remember looking at was this bar of lights flashing slowly above my head now
this is what the bar lights look like laying on a table your head is up here yeah and you're looking up you see blue
green red blue green green blue red green blue you know
back and forth uh flash flash flash flash flash flash flash flash flash flash and it was doing this and the
slower this went the more conscious I became and we able to wake up and look and look around
me when I what I I saw when I woke
up it's SL it's it's hard to really sometimes grasp
but it was like I thought in my mind there were doctors or I've been hurt i'
falling when I I remember the train tracks I didn't remember the object as much as I remembered falling at the train
tracks and I remember falling and I thought oh I must have broken my back I must have somebody must have found me
and I'm in a hospital uh you know and all STS rising to my heads until three people that were standing
there turned and looked at me MH and I had noticed that before they had turned they were looking at this bar of lights
flashing on the ceiling yeah and they were looking at a box that seemed to be off to the side at my feet uhhuh and the
box was connected to the bed you could tell it was connected by wires to the bed I was laying on or the table or
whatever it was and when they turned and looked at me it was
like all kinds of emotion this surg to the surface at once now
this is a sketch of what I believe I saw standing next to my bed or a table or
whatever you want to call it in a cold room on a metal table with
shadowy figures nearby is there any part of your body where you feel that tingling more intensely than any other
part or is it all over it's just in like gr like I fell asleep I could see my legs up cuz I
could see the tops of my knees but I had no feeling there whatsoever um but the fellow on the right was doing
something down there because I could see him could see his head right here I just can't imagine that they would
sporadically just pick people up willy-nilly and take their sperm and perform these I mean how often will do you have to do that what happens after
I'm hit with the light is that I'm taking board a ship normally I'm I'm
placed on a table the beings um
kind of look at me probe me um sometimes take sperm
samples look in my eyes my ears that type of thing and then um after that I'm
usually taken into another room and I'm literally shown um events of the earth
they've showed me future what I it seems to me to be future cataclysmic events
that um where the Earth is heading [Applause]
what happen taking me where are you I'm laying on a
table how old are you 18
19 express it more the
anger it's a trauma on four levels it's a trauma because the thing itself is so
traumatic to be helpless to be taken against your will and subjective to these intrusive rap-like procedures it's
traumatic because of the isolation that people feel they can't talk about it the parents will say well that that's your
dream again your nightmare thirdly it is philosophically shocking to people's
worldview I mean this is not supposed to be this in our worldview this is beyond extraordinary it's impossible and then
the fourth thing is that it can recur at any time I mean there's not it's not like other traumas that are over when
they're over they can taken again and two figures about my size came up one on
either side of me from behind and they said well you come with us Chris well I it was a ramp it looked
like a metallic ramp that entered a doorway and they put me on this table and they clamped my skull into like a
vice of some sort I remember I just couldn't move and I saw this contraption it was metallic and they clamped it firm
I could not move and they rammed something up the
back of my head and it hurt like the devil I was screaming and they packed me up and walk
me out of the out of the ship and I'm running back
home and they took me in into this room and the next thing I remembered under
the hypnosis was was being on a a table some kind of examination Table and there
was uh one one of these creatures was on either side of me and there was another one on the
bottom and they were they they uh they were examining me and I I felt like um
like a a polar bear you know like when our scientists go to the North Pole or St North Pole and they Dart a polar bear
and they were examining them and doing all these things as you know checking their teeth that's what they were doing
my husband and I had problems we came close to a divorce over
this until he woke up on a table being
examined by three Grays this is something that we didn't ask for we didn't want and it's totally
changed our lives here is a sperm collection procedure here's a guy who's
laying on one of these tables you Noti to the curved room and around uh and
this is uh a situation where SP is being taken and he is comforted by an
abductee a non a ion an
abductee uh which I found of no concern whatsoever when I saw this and when he
told me about it later I became interested in this so they take sperm we know that all
the time in fact uh Barney Hill in 1961 said that they had taken a per sperm
sample but when a book was written about them in 1966 uh to our amazing luck
he refused to have that put in because it was so embarrassing he didn't want
people to know and that was hugely important to us because
nobody knew that this had happened to Barney and people started describing all the time then nobody could be accused of picking it up from the Barney Betty Hill
story early on see what I mean it wasn't wasn't mentioned but it's in the testimony seemed as if I was carried up
the ramp my feet were banging against the ground as uh these small men I desired came up to me and uh carried me
from the car and through the woods and up this ramp and into this room where I opened my eyes I saw a table Betty
described the table as being adequate for her to lie on the one that the room where she was in and at this time I do
not know where Betty is and uh apparently I am more concerned for my
own welfare to be concerned about Betty but the table that I described was small
and obviously the difference in our Heights could be the answer well how
tall were these men I estimate uh well I said they were about as tall as Betty but this would mean that 51 4 and 1/2 to
5T 5T 5T yes and I'm 5'8 so that that 3 in difference was quite a difference and
I said that the table was too small where I too was given uh an examination
uh I'm very conscious about my teeth I was very upset about I only got As far as saying something went into my mouth
and I did not bother to tell the doctor and he did not press this as to what was happening but I can only think now that
this would have been when my teeth would have been extracted and pulled out yeah I should have said pulled out because
they Dentures yes and so they weren't extracted they had be but uh I go on the
put uh explain that uh the kind of examination that I had been given is a scraping of the skin and I had been
turned over they were interested in body openings and a cuplike object was placed
against my genitals and I was reluctant to to talk about that until Mr Fuller
was able to word it for me by saying low lower abdomen and this would have been the extend of the examination and then
there's in the sort of in the middle of the room is a table some kind of a table
it's not not very high about the same height to the desk
so uh I lie down on the table on my back
and he brings over this
uh uh oh how can I describe
it they're like needles there's a whole cluster in Needles and each needle has a
wire running from it so then they roll me over
I'm right
back and the examiner has a long
needle in his hand and I see
needle and it it's it's bigger than any needle I've ever
seen and I asked him what he's going to do with it
and he said just a simple St of me and I asked him what and he said he
just wants to put it in my table it's just a simple
test and I don't him know it won't hurt don't do it don't do it and he's another
won't hurt and he Tak my
[Applause]
and I'm crying and I tell her it's hurting it's hurting it hurting it
out and and then the leader he goes over and he puts his hand
ra his hand in front of my eyes and he says I'll be all right I
won't feel it [Applause]
and all the pain goes away Louise Smith ultimately remembered waking up on what seemed to be an
operating table with strange creatures peering down at her they were um about 4
to 4 and 1/2 ft tall and they wore a dark tight fitted
suit and a hood um the hood was tight fitted also you know the only thing
visible was the eyes they were very huge and pointed more to the temple not
straight across like our eyes would be there was um a notor it was almost like a a
mold have you ever smelled a refrigerator that's been fastened up that with no electric for a long time
you know and you open that door and you get this uh kind of moldy smell I smell that and I have
never been asked this question but now was an opportunity to bring this out also the odor itself I smelled stronger
when the beings were near me And when they looked at me we did not
talk uh verbally like we're talking now it was a telepathy type
thing and I would tell myself I'm not going to look at them but there was no
way I could resist you know and then at one point um they poured a
liquid over my entire body and I thought I was going to die
because I could not breathe I could not breathe and it was so hot you know so
then when they pulled it off it was like ripping a piece of tape you know from
the body and this thing and what that was Far other than I get so frightened I
think maybe they were making a mold you know and I could just barely make out the forms of what I thought were doctors
but then my vision cleared and I could see these aliens standing close and it
just completely freaked me out I mean I was already scared about the way I felt
but I just completely lost my mind with fear were you uh describe what you were
on if you can were you on a SL I was lying on my back and I was close enough to the ceiling before I even looked over
and saw them I I figured I was on some kind of a gurnie or raised operating table and I thought you know that I'd
been hurt somehow and taken to the hospital but then when I finally focused on what I thought were medical people it
was these aliens and I just flipped out okay and a lot of people think oh I
would stay calm ask good questions uh who thinks that not
me uh you know but you have to understand that you know the pain I was
feeling the feeling of something more morally wrong inside but more over the
most important feeling was that I felt like I couldn't get enough air the feeling of
Suffocation there's a scene in the movie of a membrane yes when the actor's
laying on the table and aliens are surrounding him and he's struggling to Screen through this membrane struggling
to breathe through it that didn't actually happen but I think in that case it does a better job of explaining the
source of my Panic or at least the chief source that you know that feeling of Suffocation combined with the feeling of
weakness like you you can't move when you need to move
quickly um to get away and so you know
suddenly realizing where I was gave me a shot of adrenaline enough a burst of
strength to actually sort of lash out at them it was you know pretty
weak uh and it was more of a push than a hit and I rolled away in the opposite
direction this device they had lying across my chest fell off and hit the
floor but I uh just mainly kept my eyes
on them as I backed away or stumbled backwards and when I bumped up against
this shelf behind me I just looked real quick to see what I'd run into
and there was some things there and I just grabbed the biggest thing there and started flailing in their
Direction and that stopped their approach all right two things to ask uh
one the movie depicted a lack of gravity uh you said something fell and hit the floor so obviously there was some
gravity yeah there was gravity there was no weightlessness okay and uh is actually if anything it might have been
slightly heavy gravity really uh to explain that feeling of weak Ness
although just the feeling of injury I really think that whatever happened with
that blast of energy from the craft it did so much damage that when I came to
at that point whatever efforts had been made to revive me were not complete.
